It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"octave-networks-toolbox: A set of graph/networks analysis functions in Octave\r\n\r\nThis is a repository of functions relevant to network/graph analysis, adapted for Octave. The code currently runs on GNU Octave Version 3.4.0 with Gnuplot 4.2.5. The functions do not require any additional libraries. Functional interdependencies are documented within the function headers, and visualized below.\r\n\r\nThese routines are intended for someone who is starting to analyze data as a network, and beginning to write their own code. They are easy to modify, reuse or build upon. The code is organized roughly by functionality into 10 categories, from basic routines that return the number of nodes and edges, to algorithms that build graphs with certain properties. \r\n\r\nContributions, suggestions, corrections and questions are always welcome.\r\n\r\n![functional interdependencies graph](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8211/8370609984_0977064ba7_b.jpg)","name":"Octave-networks-toolbox"}
